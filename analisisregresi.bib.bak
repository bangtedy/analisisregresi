  abstract = {If we measured personal happiness with dollar signs, then North Americans would be the cheeriest souls on Earth. Not so. Despite more than 50 years of constant economic growth and material consumption, our rates of happiness and many indicators of well-being are in decline. How can we redefine economic progress in accordance with what matters most to our quality of life: supportive relationships, meaningful work, a healthy environment and spiritual well-being? Economist Mark Anielski has developed a new and practical economic model called Genuine Wealth, to measure those real determinants of well-being and help redefine progress. This model has been used with enormous success in many communities, corporations and in countries all over the world. The Economics of Happiness shows how to measure the five capitals of Genuine Wealth: (1) human; (2) social; (3) natural; (4); built; and (5) financial. Learn how the Genuine Wealth model is being used by nations, governments, communities and businesses to build a new economy of well-being, with examples from Italy, Santa Monica and Bhutan. Discover how you and your family can apply the model in your lives. Anielski's road-map towards this vision of flourishing economies of well-being will resonate with individuals, communities and governments interested in issues of sustainability and quality of life.

Such measurements provide more accurate information that can be used to better study the associations between anatomical changes and clinical findings. Unfortunately, even with the use of quantitative image features, the correlations between anatomical changes and clinical findings are often not apparent and definite conclusions are difficult to reach. This paper uses nonparametric exploration techniques to demonstrate that even when the associations between two-variables seems weak, advanced properties of the associations can be studied and used to better understand the relationships between individual measurements. This paper uses quantitative imaging findings and clinical measurements of 85 patients with pulmonary fibrosis to demonstrate the advantages of non-linear dependency analysis. Results show that even when the correlation coefficients between imaging and clinical findings seem small, statistical measurements such as the maximum asymmetry score (MAS) and maximum edge value (MEV) can be used to better understand the hidden associations between the variables.},

  abstract = {Summary This chapter demonstrates the method of exploratory common factor analysis in SPSS. Exploratory factor analysis is quite different from components analysis. In the exploratory factor analysis, the user can exercise more modeling flexibility in terms of which parameters to fix and which to free for estimation. The major critique of exploratory factor analysis is that the loadings obtained in the procedure are not unique. The chapter demonstrates how factor loadings are in part a function of the number of factors extracted. Factor analysis generates potential factors due to correlation among observed variables. If there is no correlation among variables, then there is essentially nothing to factor analyze. The chapter concludes with a brief discussion of cluster analysis, which shares a conceptual link to factor analysis in that instead of attempting to group variables, cluster analysis attempts to group cases through a consideration of relative distances between objects.},

CRM approaches marketing as dating in which the marketer attempts to turn strangers into friends and friends into lifetime partners and to retain the loyalty of the right customers for this is the key to long-term profits in a company. Gender theories posit that women and men behave differently, and that they approach things differently. Moreover, these theories have documented a picture of women are being more expert and motivated relationship psychologists than men, as more active in their relationship monitoring, and as more oriented toward the maintenance and success of their relationships. Based on these theories, this paper develops some propositions to facilitate its empirical testing related to relationship communication and relationship dissolution in business market. The contribution of this paper is twofold. First, it attempts to create more insight into areas where relationship marketing research to date has not been abundant. Second, this paper attempts to contribute to methodological development of measuring relationship success by systematically distinguishing between good communication relationship and good management relationship.},

Across 52 studies, including 60 independent samples and 11,582 participants, satisfaction with, alternatives to, and investments in a relationship each correlated significantly with commitment to that relationship. Moreover, these three variables collectively accounted for nearly two\textendash thirds of the variance in commitment. Commitment, in turn, was found to be a significant predictor of relationship breakup. Support for the model was obtained in predicting commitment in both relational domains (e.g., commitment to a romantic partnership) and nonrelational domains (e.g., commitment to one's job), but was significantly stronger in relational domains. Additional moderator analyses suggested that the associations between commitment and its theorized bases vary minimally as a function of demographic (e.g., ethnicity) or relational (e.g., duration) factors. We review theoretical strengths and shortcomings of the Investment Model and identify directions for future research.},

  abstract = {Two experiments were designed to test the adequacy of the investment model of developing relationships in predicting satisfaction with and commitment to ongoing associations. According to the investment model, attraction to and satisfaction with a relationship is a function of a comparison of the relationship outcome value (both rewards and costs) to the individual's expectations, or comparison level. Commitment to a relationship is said to be a function not only of the relationship outcome value, but also the quality of the best available alternative and the magnitude of the individual's investment in the relationship. The intrinsic or extrinsic investment of resources serves to increase commitment by increasing the costs of leaving the relationship. Thus, increases in investment size, decreases in alternative value, and increases in relationship value should increase commitment to an ongoing relationship. In Experiment 1, a role-playing study, commitment to relationships increased with intrinsic and extrinsic investment size and decreased with the value of alternatives, but was not appreciably affected by relationship costs. Satisfaction/attraction significantly increased as relationship costs decreased. In Experiment 2, a survey of ongoing romantic associations, satisfaction/attraction was predicted by relationship reward value and relationship cost value. Commitment to relationships increased as relationship reward value and investment size increased and as alternative value and relationship cost value decreased, although the effects of cost value were weak.},

Genomic analysis revealed that SARS-CoV-2 is phylogenetically related to severe acute respiratory syndrome-like (SARS-like) bat viruses, therefore bats could be the possible primary reservoir. The intermediate source of origin and transfer to humans is not known, however, the rapid human to human transfer has been confirmed widely. There is no clinically approved antiviral drug or vaccine available to be used against COVID-19. However, few broad-spectrum antiviral drugs have been evaluated against COVID-19 in clinical trials, resulted in clinical recovery. In the current review, we summarize and comparatively analyze the emergence and pathogenicity of COVID-19 infection and previous human coronaviruses including severe ascute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV).

A range of intelligence tests were used and the scores factor analyzed to produce general, spatial and verbal factors. Test and factor scores were correlated with perceptual speed and with measures taken from 2, 4, and 8 choice RT tasks using a response keyboard upon which the subject's fingers directly rested, thus avoiding interpretive problems associated with a ``home key.'' Inspection time correlated poorly with intelligence. Only three of the RT measures produced correlations greater than .25 with the general factor. These were the slope of Hick's law, B, (correlation -.28), the 8 choice mean RT, RT8, (-.33) and the 8 choice standard deviation, SD8 (-.41), compared with the average intercorrelation between the intelligence measures of .40. Test-retest correlations of the RT measures, taken over a year for half the subjects, were low as reliability measures, with .35 for B, .52 for RT8, and .48 for SD8. Correlations of RT measures with spatial scores were not significantly greater than with verbal scores, suggesting that whatever relationship exists is with a general factor rather than only a spatial one.},

  abstract = {This research examines religious beliefs as a new antecedent to brand love, and proposes a new construct, that of Islamic brand love. Brand love as a construct has been linked with different constructs such as brand loyalty, brand trust, brand likeability, brand commitment and word-of-mouth (Albert and Merunka, 2013; Batra et al., 2012; Cengiz and Yayla, 2007; Nguyen et al., 2013). In addition, brand love can be influenced by other psychological factors such as cultural identity, religiosity or strongly held values (Batra et al., 2012). Therefore, it is suggested that religious beliefs as a cultural component can be one of the antecedents of brand love. To address the research objectives, a conceptual model was developed with 19 hypotheses to assess Islamic brand love as a focal construct, considering its antecedents (religious beliefs, subjective norms and perceived behavioural control) and consequences (word-of-mouth, brand loyalty and purchase intention). This study employed mixed-method research following a positivist research philosophy (Malhotra and Birks, 2003). From the positivist perspective, qualitative methods can be applied in the initial stages of research in order to gain a deeper understanding of the nature of the research problem and also to improve the primary research model and hypotheses (Malhotra and Birks, 2003). Since this study proposes a new construct, Churchill's (1979) paradigm is adopted to develop a new scale that measures Islamic brand love and its related constructs. The data collection process was conducted in two stages. The first stage included an assessment of the conceptual model on the basis of the qualitative study (semi-structured interviews and focus groups), while the second stage included a quantitative assessment of the model. The quantitative assessment included 539 self-administered questionnaires, which were collected to examine Muslim consumers' perceptions of Islamic brand love in Saudi Arabia. In order to make sure that the data collected was valid and reliable, exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) were employed. All the research hypotheses were tested using structural equation modelling (SEM). The model indicated an acceptable fit with the data and a good level of validity (discriminant, nomological and convergent). The outcomes of the empirical tests indicated that religious beliefs are a key factor of the Islamic brand love construct, as the proposed correlation between the two constructs was confirmed by both the qualitative findings and the empirical results. Additionally, the results of the hypothesis testing revealed that religious beliefs have a direct effect on brand loyalty and purchase intention. However, the findings showed unexpected results regarding the proposed correlation between religious beliefs and word-of-mouth, as this was not significant. The empirical results indicate that the subjective norms construct is a key determinant of Islamic brand love, word-of-mouth, brand loyalty and purchase intention, and all the proposed correlations were significant. Perceived behavioural control had a positive effect on Islamic brand love. However, the outcomes included some surprising results, as perceived behavioural control showed no relationship to three constructs (word-of-mouth, brand loyalty and purchase intention). The empirical results indicated that subjective norms were a key determinant of Islamic brand love, word-of-mouth, brand loyalty and purchase intention, and all the proposed correlations were significant. Similarly, Islamic brand love as a focal construct was considered as a key factor of its consequences (word-of-mouth, brand loyalty and purchase intention). Finally, the proposed correlation between word-of-mouth and brand loyalty, and between brand loyalty and purchase intention, were not significant. This study contributes to the existing literature by offering a new construct, Islamic brand love. This construct was developed by investigating the correlation between religious beliefs and brand love within the Islamic context. The outcomes show that Islamic brand love includes three factors: religious beliefs, subjective norms and perceived behavioural control. The findings demonstrate that Islamic brand love is an important concept for managers who want to have their brands loved by Muslim consumers. Finally, this study recommends that future research should validate the scales used, and examine the proposed correlations in different contexts.},
